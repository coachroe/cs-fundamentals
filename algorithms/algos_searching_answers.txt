## Short Answer ##
1) What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
  A: Finding a specific card in an unsorted deck of cards

-----

2) What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
  A: Finding a specific card in a sorted deck of cards

-----

3) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
  A: 7
-----

4) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
  A: 1 (since G is max value)
-----

5) Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
  A: Linear since it is unsorted, unless you have the ability to sort it before searching

-----

6) Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
  A: Binary - both would work but Binary is much faster and capable since it is a sorted colleciton

## Programming Assignment ##

1) You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

  function searchDictionary(arr, word) {
    var lowIndex = 0;
    var highIndex = arr.length - 1;
    while (lowIndex <= highIndex) {
      var midIndex = Math.floor((lowIndex + highIndex) / 2);
      if (arr[midIndex] == word) {
        return word + " at index " + midIndex;
      } else if (arr[midIndex] < word) {
        lowIndex = midIndex + 1;
      } else {
        highIndex = midIndex - 1;
      }
    } return "Not in Dictionary";
  }

  var dictionary = ["Aardvark", "Albatross", "Birdie", "Bogey", "Eagle"];
  alert(searchDictionary(dictionary, "Albatross"))

2) You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function findFish(arr, fish){
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i] === fish) {
      return "fish at index " + i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

var fishSchool = ["no spots", "no spots", "no spots", "no spots", "spotted", "no spots", "no spots", "no spots"];
alert(findFish(fishSchool, "spotted"))
