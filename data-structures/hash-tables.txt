1) What is a hash table?
  A: A key-value pair data structure that handles data similar to JS objects

-----

2) What is hashing?
  A: The conversion from a string to a numerical number.  This number is a fixed length hash code.

-----

3) How does a hash table store data?
  A: By converting the hash code to an array index and storing the value in that array index.

-----

4) How are hash tables and objects different?
  A: Hash tables and objects are different in purpose.  Hash tables are used to store data that has an identifier.  Objects hold potentially different types of data bundled together.

5) Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
    * A list of pets and their unique names. [Unclear on question, if asking about just a list of names then hash is better, if storing pet type and name then object would be better]
    * The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend. [Object]
    * The name and location of every company in a given city. [Hash]
    * All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual. [Hash]
    * The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact. [Object]

6) Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
  A:

  var arr = new Map([
   ['5555555555', 'Bob Jones, 123 Address Way, 5555555555'],
   ['4444444444', 'Mike Smith, 234 Dif Address, 4444444444'],
   ['3333333333', 'John Doe, 345 Main Street , 3333333333'],
]);
var searchPhone = arr.get('5555555555');
alert(searchPhone);

7) Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.
  A:
  var arr = new Map([
     ['1', 'Table, Wood, 25'],
     ['2', 'Chair, Metal, 3'],
     ['3', 'Mirror, Metal , 2'],
  ]);
  var searchInventory = arr.get('1');
  alert(searchInventory);


-----

8) Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

var arr = new Map([
 ['1', 'NY Times, 2018-02-25'],
 ['2', 'Chicago Tribune, 2018-02-25'],
 ['3', 'Some Journal, 2018-02-25'],
]);
var searchPaper = arr.get('1');
alert(searchPaper);
