1) What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?
  A: A stack uses a last in first out priority. It adds/removes items to the top of the stack.

  A Queue is first in first out.
-----

2) What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

They both order data to be ran in the server, just by different methods

-----

3) Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

  A: Undo - Stack using a "pop" command on the most recent item in the stack
    Redo - Stack using a "push" command to duplicate the most recent item in the stack

-----

1) Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".


var reverse = function(str) {
    var stack = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        stack.push(str[i]);
    }
    var reverseStr = '';
    while (stack.length > 0) {
        reverseStr += stack.pop();
    }
}

-----

2) Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.

CLASS Stack
 FUNCTION pop(queue)
   ...fill in pseudocode here
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS

var array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"], i;
	for (i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
  	if (array[i] == array.length -1) {
    	array.pop(array[i])
    }
  }
alert(array)

-----

3) Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).

CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
   ...fill in pseudocode here
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
   ...fill in pseudocode here
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS

var array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"], i;
	for (i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
  	if (array[i] == array.length) {
    	array.push(enqueue)
    }
  }

var enqueue = "Jim"
alert(array)

var array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"], i;
	for (i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
  	if (array[i] == array.length -1) {
    	array.pop(array[i])
    }
  }
alert(array)
